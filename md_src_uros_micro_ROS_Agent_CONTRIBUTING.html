<p >If you are a developer who is authorized to contribute to system_modes on behalf of your employer, then add your company / organization to the list of copyright holders in the [NOTICE](NOTICE) file. As author of a corporate contribution you can also add your name and corporate email address as in the Signed-off-by tag.</p>
<p >If your contribution is covered by this project's DCO's clause "(c) The
contribution was provided directly to me by some other person who certified
(a) or (b) and I have not modified it", please add the appropriate copyright holder(s) to the [NOTICE](NOTICE) file as part of your contribution. </p>
